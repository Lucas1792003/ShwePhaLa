# 05 · Roles & Permissions

Granular permission strings (e.g. `pos:create_sale`) are the **single source
of truth**. The old coarse permissions are gone.

- Frontend registry: `src/lib/permissions.ts` (+ `ALL_PERMISSIONS` and
  `DEFAULT_ROLE_PERMISSIONS` in `src/types/domain.ts`).
- SQL contract: `role_default_permissions()` in
  `014_rbac_role_tuning.sql`. The two **must be kept in sync**.

## Roles

| Role | Description | Shop scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ADMIN** | Full system access, every permission, all shops | Multi-shop |
| **MANAGER** | Shop management + operations | Assigned shop only |
| **CASHIER** | POS + own shift only | Assigned shop only |
| **BUYER** | Catalog browse + purchase-order creation | Assigned shop only |

> **BUYER is per-shop.** A shopless BUYER is a misconfiguration. The Users
> page requires a `shopId` for every non-admin role.

## User-Assignment Rules (DB-enforced)

Enforced by `020_rbac_user_assignment_constraints.sql` — a frontend bug or
direct SQL session cannot bypass them.

| Rule | How it's enforced |
| --- | --- |
| Exactly one row with `role = 'ADMIN'` may exist | Partial unique index `users_only_one_admin` |
| At most one **active** MANAGER per shop | Partial unique index `users_one_active_manager_per_shop` |
| MANAGER / CASHIER / BUYER must have `shop_id` | `enforce_user_assignment_rules()` trigger |
| ADMIN must have `shop_id = NULL` (auto-normalized) | Same trigger |
| Active CASHIER's shop must already have an active MANAGER | Same trigger |
| Removing the only active MANAGER of a shop while active cashiers remain | Same trigger — blocked unless a replacement manager is in place |

The trigger emits short, end-user-facing strings (e.g. `Manager must be
assigned to a shop.`). `src/features/admin/userFormErrors.ts` maps these
plus the two unique-index violations to the canonical UI messages.

### Manager replacement

The unique index forbids two active managers in one shop at the same time,
so manager replacement is a two-step operator flow:

1. If the shop has **no active cashiers**: deactivate or demote the old
   manager, then create / assign the new one.
2. If the shop has **active cashiers**: the only manager cannot be
   deactivated. Add a temporary second manager? Not allowed. Operators
   must either (a) temporarily deactivate the cashiers, swap the manager,
   re-enable the cashiers, or (b) deactivate the old manager only after
   another manager has been added for the shop via the brief window
   created by deactivating one and activating another in the same
   session. A dedicated `replace_manager(shop_id, new_user_id)` RPC is on
   the roadmap (see `09-roadmap-todo.md`) if this becomes a bottleneck.

### Preflight diagnostic view

`rbac_assignment_violations` (created by migration 020) lists any rows
that would violate the rules. Useful when planning a data clean-up or
debugging a stuck migration. Sample queries:

```sql
SELECT * FROM rbac_assignment_violations;
SELECT count(*) FROM users WHERE role = 'ADMIN';
SELECT shop_id, count(*) FROM users
 WHERE role = 'MANAGER' AND is_active GROUP BY shop_id HAVING count(*) > 1;
```

## Effective Permissions: Grant / Revoke Model

```
effective = roleDefaults  ∪  grantedPermissions  −  revokedPermissions
```

A revoke always wins over a role default and over a grant.

```ts
interface User {
  role: Role;
  grantedPermissions?: Permission[]; // additive
  revokedPermissions?: Permission[]; // explicit denials
  permissions?: Permission[];        // @deprecated legacy replacement list
}
```

This lets you, for example, grant one cashier `transfer:approve` without
changing their role, or grant a specific manager `report:shop_profit`.

> The deprecated `permissions` field used replacement semantics. It is
> kept only for migration safety — `002_rbac_permissions.sql` converts
> existing values into `grantedPermissions` / `revokedPermissions`, and
> `014_rbac_role_tuning.sql` remaps renamed permissions inside those
> arrays.

## Shop Scope

A matching permission is **not sufficient** for a shop-scoped action. The
user must also be allowed to act within the target shop. The helper
`hasShopPermission(user, perm, shopId)` checks both. ADMIN spans all
shops; MANAGER / CASHIER / BUYER are locked to their assigned `shopId`.

## Permission Matrix (defaults)

ADMIN holds every permission. Per-role defaults for the others below; see
the legacy detail in
[`archive/01-roles-permissions.md`](./archive/01-roles-permissions.md) for
column-by-column coverage.

### Shop / User / Audit

| Permission | M | C | B |
| --- | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| `shop:read` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `user:read` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `audit:view_shop` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

### Products / Barcodes / Pricing

| Permission | M | C | B |
| --- | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| `product:read` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `product:update` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `product:delete` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `product:edit_price` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `barcode:manage` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `pricing:manage` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

Product Units use the same catalog permissions as products: read access is
part of `product:read`, and create/update/deactivate is gated by
`product:create` or `product:update` plus barcode writes by `barcode:manage`.
POS uses Product Units read-only to select sellable units and deduct base
inventory.

`/app/admin/products` is reachable for ADMIN and MANAGER with
`product:read`, so managers can reach their product-edit workflow. The Add
Product route/action requires `product:create`; the edit route/action requires
`product:update`; delete buttons require `product:delete`. CASHIER and BUYER
use `/app/catalog` for read-only product browsing.

**Hard-deleting a product** is ADMIN-only — gated by `product:delete` and
performed via the `delete_product` RPC (migration `024`). Direct client
deletes against `products` and `inventory` are blocked at the DB layer
(no DELETE policy on `products`; all writes revoked on `inventory`).

### Inventory & Transfers

| Permission | M | C | B |
| --- | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| `inventory:view_stock` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `inventory:view_movements` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `inventory:adjust` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `inventory:damage` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `inventory:override_negative` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `transfer:view` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `transfer:create` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `transfer:approve` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `transfer:cancel` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

### POS, Sales, Receipts

| Permission | M | C | B |
| --- | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| `pos:create_sale` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `pos:apply_discount` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `pos:override_price` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `pos:override_stock` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `pos:request_refund` / `pos:request_void` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `pos:refund` / `pos:void_sale` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `sale:view` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `sales:view_own_shift` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `receipt:reprint` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

Price-level changes in POS happen from the Bills cart line pencil and require
`pos:override_price`. The modal is selector-only: Retail / Wholesale / Special
or whatever active price levels exist. Open Price products are different:
they prompt for a cashier-entered price because the product itself opts into
manual pricing.

### Suppliers & Purchasing

| Permission | M | C | B |
| --- | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| `supplier:read` | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| `supplier:update` / `supplier:create` / `supplier:delete` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `supplier:debt_view` | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| `supplier:payment_create` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `purchase:view` | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| `purchase:create` | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| `purchase:receive` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `purchase:approve` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

### Shifts & Reports

| Permission | M | C | B |
| --- | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| `shift:manage_own` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `shift:manage_all` / `shift:verify` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `report:own_shift` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `report:shop_sales` / `report:shop_inventory` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `report:shop_profit` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `report:global` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

> **Dashboard.** `/app/dashboard` is gated by `report:shop_sales`. ADMIN
> sees the all-shop business dashboard and can select a single shop.
> MANAGER is pinned to the assigned-shop operational dashboard. CASHIER
> and BUYER do not reach the route by default; if sales reporting is
> explicitly granted, CASHIER sees only own-shift data and BUYER remains
> assigned-shop scoped. Profit, margin, cost, and profit/cost columns
> require `report:shop_profit`, including the Admin Revenue, Cost &
> Profit Trend. MANAGER can see assigned-shop Sales by Category because
> it is a sales mix chart, but does not see cost/profit/investment trend
> data unless `report:shop_profit` is granted. Inventory alert cards and
> the Admin Inventory Intelligence card (stock health summary, fast/slow
> movers, reorder suggestions) require `report:shop_inventory`; supplier
> debt requires `supplier:debt_view`;
> audit activity requires `audit:view_global`. See
> [`04-features-workflows.md` > Dashboard](./04-features-workflows.md#dashboard)
> for formulas, the cost-of-goods approximation caveat, and the
> "never sum stock across shops" rule.
>
> **Shifts (open / close / view).** `/app/shifts` is one unified page
> for ADMIN, MANAGER, and CASHIER. Anyone holding `shift:manage_own` can
> open / close their own shift (admin / manager / cashier all become the
> `cashier_id` of record). ADMIN must explicitly pick a shop before opening.
> ADMIN+MANAGER additionally hold `shift:manage_all`, so the View summary
> can close someone else's open shift in their scope. CASHIER only sees and
> closes their own records. BUYER has no shift access. See
> [`04-features-workflows.md` > Shifts](./04-features-workflows.md#shifts)
> for the full table.
>
> **Work Hours visibility** mirrors RLS (`015_permission_gated_select_rls.sql`):
> ADMIN sees all shifts; MANAGER sees the assigned shop only; CASHIER
> sees their own only. Monthly totals are attributed to the local
> calendar month of `startedAt`. BUYER does not hold `shift:manage_own`
> and never reaches `/app/shifts`.
> Shift CSV export uses only the same visible, filter-applied records.

### Approvals

| Permission | M | C | B |
| --- | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| `approval:view` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Permission count

| Role | Count |
| --- | --- |
| ADMIN | 56 (full access) |
| MANAGER | 38 |
| CASHIER | 10 |
| BUYER | 5 |

## Route / Sidebar Access (summary)

The router and sidebar both consult `ROUTE_PERMISSIONS`. Sidebar entries
are filtered by the same permission plus any route-specific role gate; a user
with no `supplier:read` will not see the Suppliers nav item.

The sidebar itself can be opened or collapsed at will. The collapsed state is
stored in localStorage and renders an icon-only rail with the shop logo,
navigation icons, logout icon, and toggle button.

| Route | Permission |
| --- | --- |
| `/app/dashboard` | `report:shop_sales` |
| `/app/pos` | `pos:create_sale` |
| `/app/sales`, `/app/sales/:saleId` | `sales:view_own_shift` |
| `/app/shifts` | `shift:manage_own` |
| `/app/inventory` | `inventory:view_stock` |
| `/app/transfers` | `transfer:view` |
| `/app/purchases` | `purchase:view` |
| `/app/suppliers`, `/app/suppliers/:supplierId` | `supplier:read` |
| `/app/approvals` | `approval:view` |
| `/app/reports`, `/app/reports/profit` | `report:shop_sales` / `report:shop_profit` |
| `/app/catalog` | `product:read` |
| `/app/barcode-labels` | `product:read` + ADMIN/MANAGER role gate |
| `/app/admin/products` | `product:read` + ADMIN/MANAGER role gate (`ROUTE_PERMISSIONS.adminProducts`) |
| `/app/admin/products/new` | `product:create` (`ROUTE_PERMISSIONS.adminProductCreate`) |
| `/app/admin/products/:productId/edit` | `product:update` + ADMIN/MANAGER role gate (`ROUTE_PERMISSIONS.adminProductEdit`) |
| `/app/admin/unit-types` | `product:create` (`ROUTE_PERMISSIONS.adminUnitTypes`) |
| `/app/profile` | `user:update` + ADMIN role gate (`ROUTE_PERMISSIONS.adminSecurity`) — business brand |
| `/app/security` | `user:update` + ADMIN role gate — authenticator devices (re-verify gated) |
| `/app/admin/*` | each gated by its admin permission |

Under the **Administration** sidebar group: Shops, Users, Audit Log, Profile,
Security. Products moved to the **Inventory & Catalog** group. ADMIN sign-in
additionally requires a second factor (`/verify`) before any `/app` route loads
— see [04-features-workflows.md](./04-features-workflows.md#admin-login-verification-2fa).

## Helpers

```ts
import {
  hasPermission, hasAnyPermission, hasAllPermissions,
  hasShopPermission, canAccessShop,
  canVoidSale, canRefundSale, canAdjustInventory, canCompleteTransfer,
  canReceivePurchaseOrder, canApprovePurchaseOrder, canRecordSupplierPayment,
  canManagePriceTier,
  getEffectivePermissions, getRolePermissions,

SQL counterparts (used by RLS and RPCs):
`current_app_user()`, `app_role()`, `app_shop_id()`, `app_user_id()`,
`app_has_perm(perm)`, `app_can_for_shop(perm, shop_id)`.

## What CASHIER specifically cannot do

This is a frequent source of bugs in role-based UIs. CASHIER's narrowed
defaults (post `014`) explicitly **lack**:

- `inventory:view_movements` (Movements tab + ledger reads)
- `inventory:adjust`, `inventory:damage`, `inventory:override_negative`
- `transfer:*`, `purchase:*`, `supplier:*`
- `pos:override_price`, `pos:override_stock`
- `pos:refund`, `pos:void_sale` (can only *request*)
- `sale:view` (only `sales:view_own_shift`)
- `report:shop_sales`, `report:shop_profit`, `report:shop_inventory`,
  `report:global`
- `audit:view_shop`, `audit:view_global`
- `pricing:manage`, `barcode:manage`, `approval:view`
- `shift:manage_all`, `shift:verify`
