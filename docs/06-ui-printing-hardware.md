## Responsive Targets

The app is designed for **tablet landscape and larger**. Viewports below
`768px` render `SmallScreenGuard` instead of the app chrome:
*"This app is optimized for tablet and desktop screens. Please use a
wider screen for POS operations."*

`AppLayout` reads `useViewportWidth()` to switch.

| Width × Height | Role | Tailwind bp | Sidebar |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1024 × 768 | Tablet landscape / old POS | `lg` | 220 px |
| 1280 × 720–800 | Minimum desktop / POS monitor | `xl` | 270 px |
| 1366 × 768 | Common POS monitor | `xl` | 270 px |
| 1440 × 900 | Laptop | `xl` | 270 px |
| 1536 × 864 | Windows scaling | `2xl` | 270 px |
| 1920 × 1080 | Main desktop target | `2xl` | 270 px |
| 2560 × 1440 | Large desktop sanity | `2xl` | 270 px (content capped at `max-w-1400`) |

Tailwind breakpoints used: `lg` 1024, `xl` 1280, `2xl` 1536.

The sidebar has a persisted open/closed toggle. Open width is 220 px below
`xl` and 270 px at `xl+`; collapsed width is 76 px below `xl` and 84 px at
`xl+`. In collapsed mode only the logo, nav icons, logout icon, and toggle
remain visible.

Per-page expectations and a wide manual checklist live in
[`archive/32-responsive-testing-checklist.md`](./archive/32-responsive-testing-checklist.md).
Highlights:

- **POS** — product grid 2 / 3 / 4 columns at `lg` / `xl` / `2xl`; cart
  width `320px` below `xl`, `380px` at `xl+`. Top bar and category
  filters wrap; no horizontal scroll.
- **POS Bills** — each cart line keeps the product name and unit on
  separate lines, uses icon-only delete, stacks quantity controls, and has an
  `All` button beside the item count to open the full cart modal.
- **Tables** (Sales, Inventory, Movements, Shifts, Audit) — wrappers use
  `overflow-x-auto` with `min-w-*` so they scroll horizontally if needed
  rather than clipping.
- **Supplier Detail Page** — five summary cards, three tabs. No drawer
  horizontal scroll at 1024×768. Expanded PO line-items table is the only
  place horizontal scroll may appear, and only at very narrow widths.

## Receipt Printing

The app does **not** use a PDF generator. It uses the browser's native
print pipeline via `window.print()`, with `src/print/receipt.css` to
isolate the 80 mm `<div class="receipt">`:

- `@media print { body * { visibility: hidden; } .receipt, .receipt * { visibility: visible; } .receipt { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; …} }`
- `.print-hidden { display: none !important; }` for Topbar, Sidebar,
  Toasts, etc.
- `@page { size: 80mm auto; margin: 0; }` hints the thermal printer
  roll; A4 fallback works as a narrow band on full paper.

### POS inline print (F3) — portal trick

After F3 checkout, POS stays on the page and prints inline. The receipt
is **not** rendered in the POS tree — it's portaled directly into
`<body>` via `createPortal` so no POS ancestor establishes a positioning
context for the absolute receipt:

```jsx
{printReceipt && createPortal(
  <div className="print-only-host">
    <ReceiptPreview … />
  </div>,
  document.body,
)}
```

The `print-only-host` rule (also in `receipt.css`) uses
`display: contents` on screen so the host establishes no layout box,
and the inner `.receipt` is sized to 0×0 + `visibility: hidden` so it
takes no screen space. On print, the existing visibility cascade
reveals only the receipt subtree and the `@media print`
`position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0` rule positions it against
`<body>` (now the only positioned ancestor).

**Without the portal**, an earlier version placed the receipt host
inside POS with `position: fixed; left: -10000px` to keep it off
screen. That made the wrapper a positioned ancestor, so the
absolute receipt printed at `-10000px` off the paper edge — blank
output. The portal sidesteps this entirely.

### Silent printing (skip the print preview dialog)

`window.print()` always shows the browser preview by default. For
production tills, launch Chrome/Edge with `--kiosk-printing` so prints
go straight to the default printer with no dialog. Windows shortcut:

```
"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --kiosk-printing
```

Set the thermal printer as the system default and F3 will print silently
on every sale. Firefox equivalent: `print.always_print_silent = true` in
`about:config`.

### Print vs Reprint (Sales voucher page)

`ReceiptDetail` (the `/app/sales/:saleId` page) shows the on-screen
**Sales Voucher** and keeps the 80 mm `ReceiptPreview` mounted inside a
`.print-only-host` wrapper so the buttons below still print the thermal
receipt, not the voucher. It exposes two buttons:

| Button | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **Print** | Calls `window.print()` directly. Does NOT log. Disabled when the sale has no loaded items. |
| **Reprint** | Gated by `receipt:reprint`. Sets an in-flight flag, awaits `log_receipt_reprint`, then calls `window.print()`. Double-clicks can't create duplicate log rows. RPC failure shows a toast and skips printing. |

Cancelling the print dialog after **Reprint** does not roll back the log
row — by design, a logged reprint is a reprint *intent*.

### Receipt layout

| Block | Content |
| --- | --- |
| Brand header | Logo + business name from the editable `business_profile` (Profile page), falling back to `/logo_real.png` + `Shwe PhaLar` (`mix-blend-multiply` so a white PNG bg blends out) → shop name → address + phone → receipt no |
| Meta | Stacked grid rows: Branch · Date · Cashier · Price · Payment · Items. Fixed-width label column so colons align |
| Items table | 4 columns: Description / Qty / Price / Amount. Plain integers in numeric columns (no `MMK` per row). Dashed rule above and below the header |
| Totals | Subtotal / Discount → dashed rule → **Total** (sm + semibold) → dashed rule → Paid / Change |
| Footer | Burmese thank-you: `ဝယ်ပြီးပစ္စည်းပြန်မလဲပါ။` and `ဝယ်ယူအားပေးမှုကိုအထူးကျေးဇူးတင်ပါသည်။` |

## Barcode Labels

- Route: `/app/barcode-labels`. Gated by `product:read` + role gate
  ADMIN/MANAGER.
- Flow: select active product → preview modal → set quantity (1–200) →
  pick template → **Print labels** mounts `BarcodePrintSheet` and calls
  `window.print()`. The browser print only opens from the final button.
- Barcode value resolution (single source of truth in
  `src/features/barcodes/labels.ts`):
  1. selected Product Unit barcode (`product_barcodes.product_unit_id`)
  2. for the default unit only, fall back to `products.sku`
  3. otherwise: the selected unit cannot print a scannable label
- Labels print product name, sellable unit name, selected unit price, and
  barcode/SKU. Legacy `products.pack_size` is not printed.
- Renderer: CODE128 via
  [`src/components/barcodes/BarcodeSvg.tsx`](../src/components/barcodes/BarcodeSvg.tsx).

### Templates

`src/features/barcodes/labelTemplates.ts`:

| Key | Name | Size | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `compact` | Compact | 50mm × 25mm | Small stickers with a large barcode |
| `standard` | Standard | 60mm × 30mm | Default — name, barcode, price, code |
| `price` | Price focused | 60mm × 30mm | Shelf labels with larger price text |
| `large` | Large | 70mm × 40mm | Bigger packaging labels |

Print isolation: `src/print/labels.css` follows the same pattern as the
receipt CSS, sizing labels through `--label-width` / `--label-height` and
named `@page` hints per template. Browser support for dynamic `@page`
varies; operators may still need to choose the matching label stock in
the print dialog.

## Barcode Scanner Behavior

- The scanner is a keyboard-emulating HID device. The barcode input
  receives keystrokes and an Enter at the end of each scan.
- POS resolves the scanned code via the **same** rule the label printer
  uses: unit-linked `product_barcodes.value` first, then `products.sku`
  fallback to the default Product Unit. A package barcode adds that exact
  Product Unit; a SKU-source label scans back as the default unit. See
  [04-features-workflows.md](./04-features-workflows.md).
- The input refocuses after every scan (success or failure), so the next
  Enter-terminated burst always lands there even if a click stole focus.
- A toast confirms each successful add: `Added <product name> - <unit>`.
  Misses show `Barcode not found`. Stock guards show
  `Only X in stock for this shop.`

## Product Image Upload / Storage

- Compressed to **`<= 100 KB`** via `compressProductImage` (WebP/JPEG).
- Uploaded to the public Supabase Storage bucket **`product-images`**.
- The row stores only the public URL in `products.image_url` — never
  base64.
- Display is a plain `<img src={imageUrl}>`. Timestamped path means
  replacing an image always creates a fresh object, so a changed image is
  never hidden by browser/CDN caching.

### Phone QR upload

A QR-based phone upload flow exists for desktop product forms (when the
desktop user does not have a webcam image):

1. Desktop clicks **Upload from phone**.
2. `create_product_image_upload_session(...)` creates a session.
3. Desktop attaches a pre-scoped signed upload token to that session's
   storage path via `attach_product_image_upload_session_token(...)`.
4. The QR modal shows a QR for `/phone-upload/product-image/:token` (the
   route is unauthenticated but token-gated).
5. The phone validates the raw token via
   `get_product_image_upload_session_by_token(...)`, takes/picks a photo,
   compresses to `<= 100 KB`, uploads to
   `product-images/temp/<sessionId>/...`, then calls
   `complete_product_image_upload_session(...)`.
6. The desktop polls `get_product_image_upload_session_status(...)`,
   receives the public URL, updates the preview.

Security:

- Sessions expire after 10 minutes.
- The raw token is returned only once (the QR URL).
- The database stores only `sha256(token)`.
- A session can be completed only once.
- The phone can upload only to the session's pre-created path.
- Completion rejects wrong storage paths, > 100 KB files, unsupported
  MIME types, `data:` URLs, or URLs outside `product-images`.

## Known Storage Follow-ups

- Replacing or removing a product image does not delete the previous
  Storage object yet. Same for cancelled phone uploads. Orphan cleanup is
  a recommended follow-up (scheduled job listing `product-images` and
  deleting objects with no referencing `products.image_url` + old
  `product-images/temp/*` whose sessions are expired/canceled).

## Desktop Wrapper (Electron)

The app now also ships as a native Windows/Mac desktop app — an Electron
shell (`electron/main.cjs`, `electron/preload.cjs`) around the exact same
React app, distributed as a `.dmg` (Mac, Apple Silicon + Intel) / `.exe`
(Windows) via a **Download App** button in the sidebar footer
(`DownloadAppModal.tsx`), which links to installers published as GitHub
Releases on this repo.

What it adds over the browser version:
- **Silent receipt printing** — `webContents.print({ silent: true, ... })`
  to a system printer, no print-preview dialog and no need for the
  `--kiosk-printing` browser flag described above. Works with the existing
  80mm receipt HTML/CSS unchanged; most ESC/POS thermal printers install as
  a normal OS printer via the manufacturer's driver, so no raw ESC/POS byte
  protocol was needed. `src/lib/print.ts` feature-detects
  `window.electronAPI` and falls back to `window.print()` in the browser.
- **Offline POS mode with sync** — this is the bigger piece; see
  [`10-offline-desktop-known-issues.md`](./10-offline-desktop-known-issues.md)
  for the full design (local IndexedDB mirror, write outbox, delta sync)
  and exactly which flows are offline-capable vs. still online-only. This
  part works identically in the browser and in the desktop app — it's not
  Electron-specific.
- **Auto-update** — the desktop app checks this repo's GitHub Releases on
  launch and periodically, downloading and prompting to install updates.

Still not implemented: talking to OPOS/JavaPOS cash drawers or barcode
scanners with native drivers (scanners still work today via HID keyboard
emulation, same as the browser version; drawers need a printer-model-
specific ESC/POS kick command or direct USB/serial access, neither
wired up yet — no hardware available to build/verify it against). Full
gap list, including code-signing status and the release/publish process,
is in [`10-offline-desktop-known-issues.md`](./10-offline-desktop-known-issues.md).
