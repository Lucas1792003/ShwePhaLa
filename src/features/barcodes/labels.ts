 * needs to render a scannable code for a product).
 *
 * Rule: prefer the product's first registered `product_barcodes.value`
 * (that's what POS scanning resolves against today); fall back to
 * `products.sku` so a freshly created product is still printable as soon
 * as its SKU exists. Return `null` if neither is available — the label
 * cannot be printed.
 *
 * Selecting "first" is intentional: there is no notion of a primary /
 * active barcode in the schema, so order from the store is the only
 * stable signal. If a primary barcode concept is added later, switch the
 * selection here and POS lookup together.
